## Season two / 2019–20

The work-in-progress website for the second study season, not yet deployed live, is on the branch `season-two/master`.

This version is being developed as a collaboration between the [Bedford Lab](https://bedford.io) and [Formative](https://formativeco.com).


### Starting the server

Make sure the dependencies are installed by running `npm run install`.

Then, start the server with `npm run start`.
The development server is now running at http://localhost:8080


### Development

The Seattle Flu Website is built using [Embedded Javascript Templates](https://ejs.co) and [Express](https://expressjs.com).

The main application is the Seattle Flu Study website.
It comprises multiple React applications that are added via routes and views.
These applications can be developed in isolation from the main application (i.e. website) by starting the server within each application's top-level directory.


#### Main application

The code for the `express` server lives at [app.js](./app.js).
`app.js` starts the app, sets up the engine, mounts middleware to the declared routers, loads static files from provided paths, and declares error handling.


#### Routes

Routers live at `routes/`.
They perform minimal work, declaring `GET` endpoints at the paths provided by the middleware.
Routers also pass context to `this` for `ejs` to render in its templates, e.g. `title`.


#### Views

Views live at `views/` as `.ejs` files.
These files are only loaded in the main application.
Views that require JavaScript need two things:
1. A `div` with an `id` that the JavaScript file will use to manipulate the DOM.
2. A `script` tag of type `text/javascript` that loads the desired JavaScript bundle from the top-level directory.
    >Recall: Available static files (like JavaScript bundles) are declared by adding their paths in `app.js`.


#### Services

Middleware lives at `services/`.
This is where we are currently defining methods for retrieving data from the Contentful SDK.
These functions can be imported either by routers or within React apps.
> See: [Contentful + React](#contentful--react)


#### Contentful CMS

We are currently using [Contentful](https://contentful.com) as our content management system (CMS).


##### Content types

When defining [content models](https://www.contentful.com/developers/docs/concepts/data-model/), we have had the best success rendering `Long text` or `Short text` fields.
This requires converting the returned Markdown text to HTML using a library such as [react-markdown](https://github.com/rexxars/react-markdown).
We do not recommend declaring fields as Rich Text because each field is stored with multiple nodes, making programmatic access more irregular and error-prone.


##### Environment variables

The following environment variables must be defined to run the website locally:
* CONTENTFUL_ACCESS_TOKEN
* CONTENTFUL_SPACE

Once you have been invited to the Seattle Flu Study space on Contentful, these API keys are accessible under Settings → API Keys → website-dev.


##### Contentful + React

Browser-side code that uses the Contentful SDK needs a way to access the Contentful environment variables.
To achieve this, we define our environmental variables with Webpack.
Open up `webpack.config.js` within the directory of the React app that needs access to these variables. Require webpack with:
```js
    const webpack = require('webpack');
```

Next, still inside of `webpack.config.js`, define the Contentful environment variables:
```js
    const ENV = {
        CONTENTFUL_ACCESS_TOKEN: JSON.stringify(process.env.CONTENTFUL_ACCESS_TOKEN),
        CONTENTFUL_SPACE: JSON.stringify(process.env.CONTENTFUL_SPACE),
    }
```

Then, add the following line to `plugins`:
```js
    plugins: [
        new webpack.DefinePlugin({ 'process.env': ENV }),
        ...
  ]
```

The Contentful API keys will now be available as environment variables to the modified React app.


#### React applications

Smaller React applications live within this repository.
They are named after the web page they represent (e.g. `enroll`).
They consist of an `index.html` file under `src/` which is only visible to the React application.

>Recall: The main application instead renders a view of the React application from a bundled JavaScript file.

##### Starting the server

Make sure the dependencies are installed by running `npm run install`.

Then, start the server with `npm run start`.
The development server is now running at http://localhost:8080


##### Building JavaScript bundles

Make sure the dependencies are installed by running `npm run install`.

Then, run webpack with `npm run build`.
The bundled React application now lives at `dist/`.


##### Adding CSS files

There are two primary ways to add CSS to your React app.

1. **Import CSS from the bundled files.**

    In this option, create a CSS file in `./dist/css` named after your app, for example:

        cd my-component/dist
        mkdir css
        touch css/my-component.css
        cd ..

    Then, **outside** of the `dist/` directory, add the following code to `index.html` to include a link to the newly created CSS file.

    ```html
        <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="/dist/css/my-component.css">
    ```

    Finally, you must provide the main website `app.js` the path to your new, static CSS file by adding the following line to `app.js`:

    ```js
        app.use(express.static(path.join(__dirname, 'my-component/dist/css')))
    ```

2. **Import CSS in your React app (JSX) file.**

    This option requires some Webpack configuration.
    It is particularly useful if you are importing CSS file from external modules.

    Import the desired CSS file into your React app as normal.
    Then, run:

        npm install --save-dev css-loader

    Next, add the following code to `./webpack.config.js` under `module.rules`:

    ```js
            { test: /\.css$/, use: 'css-loader' },
    ```


##### Adding other files (.svg, .png, etc.)

By default, `babel-loader` and `html-loader` are already included in the Webpcak config file.
If you need additional file loaders, search for Webpack file loaders such as [file-loader](https://webpack.js.org/loaders/file-loader/) or [svg-url-loader](https://www.npmjs.com/package/svg-url-loader) to see if they fit your needs.
Install them following example #2 in [Adding CSS files](#adding-css-files).


##### Babel troubleshooting

If your app is throwing an error in the console saying...
*  `Add @babel/plugin-proposal-class-properties to the 'plugins' section of your Babel config...`, run:

        npm install --save-dev @babel/plugin-proposal-class-properties

    Now add the following line to `./.babelrc`:

        "plugins": ["@babel/plugin-proposal-class-properties"],

* `ReferenceError: regeneratorRuntime is not defined`, run:

        npm install --save-dev babel-polyfill

    Then add the following line to the top of the culprit React (JSX) file:

    ```js
        import "babel-polyfill";
    ```

##### React + Mapbox
The website comprises two maps found at `/current` and at `/science/map`.
We produce these maps within React using [react-map-gl SDK](https://uber.github.io/react-map-gl/#/), a wrapper for [Mapbox GL JS](https://docs.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/api/).

React state changes should always be handled through the `setState()` request (see the [React docs on setState()](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-component.html#setstate)).
The `<MapboxGL>` component from `react-map-gl` is a fairly complicated object.
Because we are only clients of that component, we cannot guarantee that changes
to the map will always result in a state change that goes through `setState()`.
Therefore, it is safest if we store the map styles as [immutable](https://immutable-js.github.io/immutable-js/docs/#/) objects.


##### Adding new React applications

Adding new React applications to the main website is a fairly involved process with many moving pieces. However, this guide should help you through, step-by-step!
1. At the top level of this repo, copy `template-react-app/` and name your desired webpage.
   For example, if we want our new page on the website to be named `my-component`, we run

        cp -r template-react-app/ my-component
        cd my-component/

2. Inside the newly created `my-component/` directory, open up the `webpack.config.js` file.
   Near the top of the file, you should see an `output` key that looks like this:

        output: {
            filename: 'js/template-bundle.js'
        },

    Rename `template-bundle.js` to a uniquely appropriate name for your new web page.
    Following our `my-component` example, we replace `template-bundle` in the filename with `my-component-bundle`.
    > Note: it's important to keep the `js/` prefix on your new bundle file name!

3. Open up the `src/index.html` file.
   Find the lines near the middle of the file that look like this:

    ```html
        <div id="target-dom-element">
            <!-- React app inserts itself here -->
        </div>
    ```

    This is the DOM element our React app will target.
    You may rename the `div id` later to something more appropriate, but for now, we'll keep it as `target-dom-element`.

4. Now you're ready to start writing your React components!
   Open up `src/index.js`.
   This is your main React component (currently named `App`).
   Feel free to import components from external files here and develop with React as normal.

   Find the following code near the bottom of your `App` React component:

    ```js
        const wrapper = document.getElementById('target-dom-element')
    ```

    The argument passed to `document.getElementById()` must match an `id` in `src/index.html`, or the JavaScript will not load on the web page.

5. When you're ready to view your React app in action, run the following code inside your React app directory:

        npm install
        npm run start

   Once you're satisfied with your app, create bundled JavaScript files using Webpack by running:

        npm run build

6. Make sure you're back at the top-level of the repo.
   Create a new file under `routes/`, following the convention of naming the newly created file after the desired path to your new webpage.

        cd ..
        touch routes/my-component.js

    Paste the following code into the newly created JavaScript file:

    ```js
        var express = require('express')
        var router = express.Router()

        router.get('/', function (req, res, next) {
        res.render('my-component', { title: 'My Component Page' })
        })

        module.exports = router
    ```

    Now the `GET` endpoint is ready to serve the home page of our newly created React app.

7. Next, open up `app.js` from the current directory.
   At the top of the page, import your newly created router from step 6.

    ```js
        var myComponentRouter = require('./routes/my-component')
    ```

   Then add a path to the static, bundled JavaScript files.

    ```js
        app.use(express.static(path.join(__dirname, 'my-component/dist/js')))
    ```

   After that, add a new path to your new webpage with `app.use()`.

    ```js
        app.use('/my-component', myComponentRouter)
    ```

8. Almost there!
   Now create a new file under `views/`, following the same naming convention we've employed so far.

        touch views/my-component.ejs

    Paste the following code in your newly created `ejs` file.

    ```js
        <% include ./partials/header  %>

        <div class="container">
            <div class="row mt-5">
                <div class="col-md-4 offset-md-1">
                    <h1><%= title %></h1>
                    <div id="target-dom-element">
                        <!-- React app inserts itself here -->
                    </div>
                </div>
            </div>
        </div>

        <script type="text/javascript" src="/my-component-bundle.js"></script>

        <% include ./partials/footer  %>
    ```

    There are two parts working together in this code that load your React app.
    1. The `div id`, `target-dom-element`, is the target DOM element specified by your React app's `app.js` file. This is the `div` where your app will render.
    2. The `script` tag near the bottom of the file.
       The `src` specifies which JavaScript bundle will be loaded among those declared in the main application `app.js`.

9. You're done! From the top-level directory, run

        npm run start


## Season one / 2018–19

The website for the first study season, and what’s live currently, is on the branch `master`.
